# ======== Set up access to API ========================================
# Make sure you are logged into your Monash student account.
# Go to: https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python
# Click on "Enable the Google Calendar API"
# Configure your OAuth client - select "Desktop app", then proceed
# Click on "Download Client Configuration" to obtain a credential.json file
# Do not share your credential.json file with anybody else, and do not commit it to your A2 git repository.


# ========= Provide access to your google account ==========================
# When app is run for the first time, you will need to sign in using your Monash student account.
# Allow the "View your calendars" permission request.


# Students must have their own api key
# No test cases needed for authentication, but authentication may required for running the app very first time.
